excerpt: 'Recently, federated learning (FL) emerges as a promising framework to collect the dispersed data and train a collaborative machine learning (ML) model with privacy protection. An incentive scheme plays a crucial role in the FL system as they encourage long-term client joining. This project proposes a new round-based data valuation (RDV) approach to serve as a real-time incentive mechanism. It takes advantage of the FL systemâ€™s unique model aggregation property to increase the valuation efficiency and provide a fine-grained contribution estimation on a per-round basis. It also offers a guideline for the central server to selectively aggregate the local updates to train a better-performing model. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of RDV in identifying high-quality participants, the efficiency in allocating payoff, and its potentials in federation optimization.'
