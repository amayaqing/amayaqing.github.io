excerpt: 'Stock market prediction is always an attractive and challenging task among investors as it contributes to developing effective strategies in stock trading. This project developed a comprehensive stock prediction system employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and several traditional machine learning models to forecast long-term stock trends and short-term up/down phenomena. Our model takes the publicly available historical stock price as long as topic-related tweets to drive predictions by both history and public knowledge. Empirical experiments show that our models achieve around 80% validation accuracy. We built a dashboard application to offer our prediction results and serve for public usage.'
